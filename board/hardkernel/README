Intro
=====
To be able to use ODROID-C3/N2 board with the images generated by
Buildroot, you have to prepare the SDCard or eMMC.

How to build it
===============

For ODROID-C3,
  $ make odroidc3_release_defconfig

For ODROID-N2,
  $ make odroidn2_release_defconfig

Then you can edit the build options using

  $ make menuconfig

Compile all and build rootfs image:

  $ make

Note: you will need to have access to the network, since Buildroot will
download the packages' sources.

Result of the build
-------------------

After building, you should obtain this tree:

    output/images/
    +-- Image.gz
    +-- boot.ini                   [1]
    +-- boot.scr                   [2]
    +-- boot.cmd                   [3]
    +-- boot.vfat
    +-- meson64_odroidc3.dtb       [4]
    +-- meson64_odroidn2.dtb       [5]
    +-- rootfs.ext2
    +-- rootfs.ext4
    +-- rootfs.cpio
    +-- rootfs.tar
    +-- sdcard.img
    `-- u-boot.bin

[1] This is the ODROID-C3/N2 configuration file used in u-boot and
    can be loaded by 'cfgload' command
[2] The boot script for U-boot and can be executed by 'source' command
[3] The original boot config or script for [1] and [2]
[4] Only for ODROID-C3
[5] Only for ODROID-N2

How to write the SD card or eMMC
================================

Once the build process is finished you will have an image called "sdcard.img"
in the output/images/ directory.

Copy the bootable "sdcard.img" onto an SD card or eMMC with "dd":

  $ sudo dd if=output/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdX conv=fsync

Insert the SDcard into your ODROID-C3/N2, and power it up. Your new system
should come up now.
